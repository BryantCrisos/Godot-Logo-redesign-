# Godot Logo redesign
The Godot Team + Contributors got me inspired with the release of 4.6. I wanted to make a logo reflective of all the hardwork they put in to make 
this engine feel better, new, and modern. I like the current logo ALOT (Credit to Andrea Calabró) so I tried my best to keep the essence of it
and not change too much. I also noticed [Tibo's 3D Plushie Model](https://github.com/gtibo/Godot-Plush-Character) being used a handful of times 
during major updates. Another big source of inspiration for the design with my own added touch. <br><br>If you're looking for something new to slap on the splash screen, Hope this is it!
<br>-Happy game deving! 🎉🕹🎮
